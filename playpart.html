            Avinash Vengalasetti acts in a play

        <h3>
            Name of the Play:  Hedda Gabler

            Author: Henrik Ibsen

        <p>
            The room at the TESMANS' as in the first Act, except that the
            piano has been removed, and an elegant little writing-table
            with the book-shelves put in its place.  A smaller table
            stands near the sofa on the left.  Most of the bouquets have
            been taken away.  MRS. ELVSTED'S bouquet is upon the large
            table in front.--It is afternoon.
         <br> 
            <h6>HEDDA</h6>, <p>
                dressed to receive callers, is alone in the room. She
                stands by the open glass door, loading a revolver.  The
                fellow to it lies in an open pistol-case on the writing-
                table.
            </p>
            <br> 

          
          <h6>HEDDA</h6>.
          
          <p>[Looks down the garden, and calls:]</p> <p>So you are here again, Judge!</p>
          <br> 
   
          
          <h6>BRACK</h6>
          
          <p>[Is heard calling from a distance.]</p> <p>As you see,</p>
          
          <br> 
 
          <h6>HEDDA</h6>
          
          <p>[Raises the pistol and points.]</p> <p>Now I'll shoot you, Judge Brack!</p>
          <br> 
 
          
          <h6>BRACK</h6>
          
          <p>[Calling unseen.]</p> <p>No, no, no! Don't stand aiming at me!</p>
          <br> 
 
          
          <h6>HEDDA</h6>
          
          <p>This is what comes of sneaking in by the back way.</p>(7) <p>[She fires.</p>
          <br> 

          
          <h6>BRACK.</h6>
          
          <p>[Nearer.]</p> <p>Are you out of your senses--!</p>
          
          <br> 

          <h6>HEDDA.</h6>
          
          <p>Dear me--did I happen to hit you?</p>
          
          <br> 

          BRACK.
          
          <p>[Still outside.]</p> <p>I wish you would let these pranks alone!</p>
          <br> 

          
          <h6>HEDDA.</h6>
          
          <p>Come in then, Judge.</p>
          
          <br> 

            <p>JUDGE BRACK, dressed as though for a men's party, enters by
            the glass door.  He carries a light overcoat over his arm.
            <br> 
            </p>
            
          <h6>BRACK.</h6>
          
          <p>What the deuce--haven't you tired of that sport, yet? What are you
          shooting at?</p>
          <br> 

          
          <h6>HEDDA.</h6>
          
          <p>Oh, I am only firing in the air.</p>
          <br> 

          
          <h6>BRACK.</h6>
          
          <p>[Gently takes the pistol out of her hand.] Allow me, madam! [Looks at
          it.]</p> Ah--I know this pistol well! <p>[Looks around.]</p> Where is the case? Ah,
          here it is. <p>[Lays the pistol in it, and shuts it.]</p> <p>Now we won't play at
          that game any more to-day.</p>
          <br> 

          
          <h6>HEDDA.</h6>
          
          <p>Then what in heaven's name would you have me do with myself?</p>
          <br> 

          
          <h6>BRACK.</h6>
          
          <p>Have you had no visitors?</p>
          <br> 

          
          <h6>HEDDA.</h6>
          
          <p>[Closing the glass door.]</p> Not one. <p>I suppose all our set are still out
          of town.</p>
          <br> 

          
          <h6>BRACK.</h6>
          
          <p>And is Tesman not at home either?</p>
          <br> 

          
          <h6>HEDDA.</h6>
          
          <p>[At the writing-table, putting the pistol-case in a drawer which she
          shuts.]</p>  <p>No. He rushed off to his aunt's directly after lunch; he didn't
          expect you so early.</p>
          <br> 

          
          <h6>BRACK.</h6>
          
          <p>H'm--how stupid of me not to have thought of that!</p>
          <br> 

          
          <h6>HEDDA.</h6>
          
          <p>[Turning her head to look at him.]</p>  <p>Why stupid?</p>
          
          <br> 

          <h6>BRACK.</h6>
          
          <p>Because if I had thought of it I should have come a little--earlier.</p>
          <br> 

          
          <h6>HEDDA.</h6>
          
          <p>[Crossing the room.]</p>  <p>Then you would have found no one to receive you;
          for I have been in my room changing my dress ever since lunch.</p>
          <br> 

          
          <h6>BRACK.</h6>
          
          <p>And is there no sort of little chink that we could hold a parley
          through?</p>
          <br> 

          
          <h6>HEDDA.</h6>
          
          <p>You have forgotten to arrange one.</p>
          <br> 

          
          <h6>BRACK.</h6>
          
          <p>That was another piece of stupidity.</p>
          <br> 

          
          <h6>HEDDA.</h6>
          
          <p>Well, we must just settle down here--and wait. Tesman is not likely to
          be back for some time yet.</p>
          <br> 

          
          <h6>BRACK.</h6>
          
          <p>Never mind; I shall not be impatient.</p>
          <br> 

          
            <h6>HEDDA</h6> <p>seats herself in the corner of the sofa.  <h6>BRACK</h6> lays his
            overcoat over the back of the nearest chair, and sits down, but
            keeps his hat in his hand.  A short silence.  They look at each
            other.</p>
            <br> 

          
          <h6>HEDDA.</h6>
          
          <p>Well?</p>
          <br> 

          
          <h6>BRACK.</h6>
          
          <p>[In the same tone.]</p> <p>Well?</p>
          <br> 

          
          <h6>HEDDA.</h6>
          
          <p>I spoke first.</p>
          <br> 

          
          <h6>BRACK.</h6>
          
          <p>[Bending a little forward.]</p> <p>Come, let us have a cosy little chat, Mrs.
          Hedda.(8)</p>
          <br> 

          
          <h6>HEDDA.</h6>
          
          <p>[Leaning further back in the sofa.]</p> <p>Does it not seem like a whole
          eternity since our last talk? Of course I don't count those few words
          yesterday evening and this morning.</p>
          <br> 

          
          <h6>BRACK.</h6>
          
          <p>You mean since our last confidential talk? Our last _tete-a-tete_?</p>
          <br> 

          
          <h6>HEDDA.</h6>
          
          <p>Well yes--since you put it so.</p>
          <br>
