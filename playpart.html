        <h1>
            Avinash Vengalasetti acts in a play
        </h1>
        <h3>
            Name of the Play:  Hedda Gabler
        </h3>
        <p>
            The room at the TESMANS' as in the first Act, except that the
            piano has been removed, and an elegant little writing-table
            with the book-shelves put in its place.  A smaller table
            stands near the sofa on the left.  Most of the bouquets have
            been taken away.  MRS. ELVSTED'S bouquet is upon the large
            table in front.--It is afternoon.
         <br> 
            HEDDA, dressed to receive callers, is alone in the room. She
            stands by the open glass door, loading a revolver.  The
            fellow to it lies in an open pistol-case on the writing-
            table.
            <br> 

          
          HEDDA.
          
          [Looks down the garden, and calls:] So you are here again, Judge!
          <br> 
   
          
          BRACK.
          
          [Is heard calling from a distance.] As you see, Mrs. Tesman!
          
          <br> 
 
          HEDDA.
          
          [Raises the pistol and points.] Now I'll shoot you, Judge Brack!
          <br> 
 
          
          BRACK.
          
          [Calling unseen.] No, no, no! Don't stand aiming at me!
          <br> 
 
          
          HEDDA.
          
          This is what comes of sneaking in by the back way.(7) [She fires.
          <br> 

          
          BRACK.
          
          [Nearer.] Are you out of your senses--!
          
          <br> 

          HEDDA.
          
          Dear me--did I happen to hit you?
          
          <br> 

          BRACK.
          
          [Still outside.] I wish you would let these pranks alone!
          <br> 

          
          HEDDA.
          
          Come in then, Judge.
          
          <br> 

            JUDGE BRACK, dressed as though for a men's party, enters by
            the glass door.  He carries a light overcoat over his arm.
            <br> 

          
          BRACK.
          
          What the deuce--haven't you tired of that sport, yet? What are you
          shooting at?
          <br> 

          
          HEDDA.
          
          Oh, I am only firing in the air.
          <br> 

          
          BRACK.
          
          [Gently takes the pistol out of her hand.] Allow me, madam! [Looks at
          it.] Ah--I know this pistol well! [Looks around.] Where is the case? Ah,
          here it is. [Lays the pistol in it, and shuts it.] Now we won't play at
          that game any more to-day.
          <br> 

          
          HEDDA.
          
          Then what in heaven's name would you have me do with myself?
          <br> 

          
          BRACK.
          
          Have you had no visitors?
          <br> 

          
          HEDDA.
          
          [Closing the glass door.] Not one. I suppose all our set are still out
          of town.
          <br> 

          
          BRACK.
          
          And is Tesman not at home either?
          <br> 

          
          HEDDA.
          
          [At the writing-table, putting the pistol-case in a drawer which she
          shuts.] No. He rushed off to his aunt's directly after lunch; he didn't
          expect you so early.
          <br> 

          
          BRACK.
          
          H'm--how stupid of me not to have thought of that!
          <br> 

          
          HEDDA.
          
          [Turning her head to look at him.] Why stupid?
          
          <br> 

          BRACK.
          
          Because if I had thought of it I should have come a little--earlier.
          <br> 

          
          HEDDA.
          
          [Crossing the room.] Then you would have found no one to receive you;
          for I have been in my room changing my dress ever since lunch.
          <br> 

          
          BRACK.
          
          And is there no sort of little chink that we could hold a parley
          through?
          <br> 

          
          HEDDA.
          
          You have forgotten to arrange one.
          <br> 

          
          BRACK.
          
          That was another piece of stupidity.
          <br> 

          
          HEDDA.
          
          Well, we must just settle down here--and wait. Tesman is not likely to
          be back for some time yet.
          <br> 

          
          BRACK.
          
          Never mind; I shall not be impatient.
          <br> 

          
            HEDDA seats herself in the corner of the sofa.  BRACK lays his
            overcoat over the back of the nearest chair, and sits down, but
            keeps his hat in his hand.  A short silence.  They look at each
            other.
            <br> 

          
          HEDDA.
          
          Well?
          <br> 

          
          BRACK.
          
          [In the same tone.] Well?
          <br> 

          
          HEDDA.
          
          I spoke first.
          <br> 

          
          BRACK.
          
          [Bending a little forward.] Come, let us have a cosy little chat, Mrs.
          Hedda.(8)
          <br> 

          
          HEDDA.
          
          [Leaning further back in the sofa.] Does it not seem like a whole
          eternity since our last talk? Of course I don't count those few words
          yesterday evening and this morning.
          <br> 

          
          BRACK.
          
          You mean since our last confidential talk? Our last _tete-a-tete_?
          <br> 

          
          HEDDA.
          
          Well yes--since you put it so.
          <br>
