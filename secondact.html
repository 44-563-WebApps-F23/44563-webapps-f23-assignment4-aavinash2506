            The room at the TESMANS' as in the first Act, except that the
            piano has been removed, and an elegant little writing-table
            with the book-shelves put in its place.  A smaller table
            stands near the sofa on the left.  Most of the bouquets have
            been taken away.  MRS. ELVSTED'S bouquet is upon the large
            table in front.--It is afternoon.

                dressed to receive callers, is alone in the room. She
                stands by the open glass door, loading a revolver.  The
                fellow to it lies in an open pistol-case on the writing-
                table.
